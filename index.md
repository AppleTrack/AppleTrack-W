# Welcome to AppleTrack!

## AppleTrack Introduction

Welcome to AppleTrack, an amateur idea turned into an open-source project that allows the user to track a moving projectile using an Arduino or Pi with both GPS and Telemetry functionality.

The idea of AppleTrack came about in the Summer of 2017, in the Scottish back-garden of Simon's great aunt. An apple tree was in the back garden. Simon began to throw the apples into the air, to see how high they could get.
